                                (Statistical Analysis doesn't care.)






















                        In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be
                         learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database.

















                                Prohibit adversaries to reverse-engineer the sensitive data from what have been released is tackled
                                 by a probabilistic theory called differential privacy.














                But what it means when an anonymized dataset can lead to re-identify individuals ? Imagine what would be the
                 consequences.




















                         In Non-Differential Privacy, internationals citizens of Eindhoven are now exposing their International
                          data to a certain entity, undisclosed. A tool have been conceived to vizualize them per individual.




















                                Like Papers, Please game from Lucas Pope, the player here accesses sensitive data about
                                 internationals and have a detailed picture of the whereabouts of any internationals in the city,
                                  just by clicks on a mouse.


















                While this scenario might be speculative, there is evidences of reverse engineering attempts used by companies,
                 insurers, banks, and totalitary states in an attempt to identify or profile individuals.`
